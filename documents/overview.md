4. Project Implementation and timelines
- Technology used: 
- i. ReactJS: provide a user interface that users give input and display output
- ii. Java + Springboot: provide server side scriptings that process the business as given the input from the interface and return output to UI
- iii. Databases include MySQL to store data for the application only. Redis as a NoSQL server to store business data and stored procedures/functions/queue messages
- Learning curve: Redis, ReactJS, external APIs or web crawler technology such as luminati.io. 


ReactJS is one of the current hot topic among web development. Since it is one of the most popular web programming technologies so far, it is a good approach to include them in this project as they can help the development team meets the latest trend in the current situation. As for Redis and luminati.io or other substitute APIs such as LinkedIn or Glassdoors API, none of the team members is exposed to those technologies. Therefore, this would be a good opportunity to tackle new knowledge and bring a fresh idea on how to work on alternative techniques.

5. Monitoring and evaluation: 
Resume Factory should deliver these functions: 
- Users is allowed to give resume or a job posting as their inputs
- Application should suggest relevant job postings or resumes to a specific target
- Application should be able to handle multiple requests at a time and store precise data on user's information and input.
