The Resume Factory Project Plan

1. Project Title
Resume Factory – a web app that matches job postings base on a user’s resume and helps recruiters selecting the applicant’s resumes for the highest possibility to get an interview.

2. Abstract / Statement of the problem
a. Purpose and reason for this project
The purpose of the Resume Factory is to provide job seekers a helping tool to speed up the application process so that they can focus more on the interview preparation. Also, Resume Factory is a place for recruiters to collect a pool of applicants when they look for a particular skill set.

b. What problem is this project designed to address/resolve?
The application process is complicated and typically takes much time when the applicants must search the most relevant jobs for them. Due to students’ experiences in applying for part-time and internship jobs, the chance to get an interview is meager and frustrating. Many people do not know how to alter their resumes to pass the Applicant Tracking System (ATS). They usually fail in CV screening because of applying only one resume for multiple job postings. On the recruiters’ side, they also receive many applications, and they have to work hard for collecting and scanning all of the CVs to find suitable candidates to be interviewed. Even with the help of modern technology as ATS, there are still chances of missing information here and there.

c. What makes your project “unique” and/or different from other available solutions?
The Resume Factory is unique because of the following reasons:
    • Firstly, the Resume Factory focuses on the freshers and junior levels, who are typically rejected by the companies. They are lack of experience and do not know how to alter their resumes. If they have chances to prove themselves and contribute to the chosen company, it is efficient for both sides.
    • Unlike other competitors like Linkedin, Glassdoor, and Indeed, the Resume Factory can suggest jobs base on users’ abilities and interests. Therefore, users do not have to search and scan irrelevant job postings.
    • Lastly, Resume Factory can suggest profiles to the recruiters as they need by matching keywords and skills. The recruiters can save time in collecting applicant data when needed.
